This functionality is used so that the company can store its information in the application.
So when an administrator or manager of the company needs it, they can consult this information directly in the Manage Company page.
This information can be name, e-mail, phone number, address, country, district and postal code.

To test the “Manage Company Info” functionality, 2 tests will be created.
The first one will be done through an authenticated user and its goal is to test the visualization of company information.
The second one will test the edition of company information and needs to be through an administrator type user (Company Administrator).
