Currently in the application of quickstock all registrations must be made by company administrators. 
Due to the high number of users of the companies, it is necessary a feature so that users without an account can regist on the platform.
In order to implement this functionality, a token will be associated with each company so that users can register and be automatically associated with the companies.

Therefore, in order to register, you will need to fill out a form with 4 fields:
- email: individual identification of each user;
- password: password for protecting user accounts;
- password confirmation: confirmation of the previously entered password;
- token: token of the user's company.

When the fields are inserted correctly, the account is created for the user and is redirected to the application. 
When any of the fields is invalid, the user will be notified with the problem in their registration.

To test this functionality, 1 test will be created.
