In order for a company to be able to organize its products, it is important that they are classified by their type. So this functionality aims to reformulate the attributes of the company's products. 
With this functionality, is inserted the attribute "Product type", which can only assume predefined values.
These predefined values can be changed, with the possibility of create, edit and delete.
To confirm that all the refactor was successful, the view of the product details, the create and the edit product features are also tested

To test the "Product type" functionality, 7 tests will be created and all will be done through a authenticated user(Company administrator or manager).
